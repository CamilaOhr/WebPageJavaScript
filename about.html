          <h4>A Designer</h4>
            <p>As a design professional, with special emphasis on user-centered design and experience design.I have developed the skills of research, analysis and creation of innovative ideas around a concept, user or need. I believe that the most important thing is that products solve a problem or need, that they are accessible and most of all that they are enjoyable for the people who use them.</p>
            
            <p>  I am an innately curious person, I can't stop learning and I consider it is important to know about other areas of knowledge in order to develop viable and innovative ideas. That's why I have studied marketing, Product management, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
              
            <p> However, something that I love and have been passionate about since I was a child are video games, anime and everything that allows me to interact and "Play" with them, especially when they are digital products. That's why I also studied Video Game Development with Unity and I'm still training nowadays to be able to make fun and interactive products on the web, mobile and game consoles. </p>
              
            <p>  My current goal is to work on projects that allow me to create interactive, immersive and unique digital spaces and experiences. Designing and developing the environment, accessories, navigation and experience. I want to work in virtual or augmented reality, game development, Level Design, environment art, web design and UX/UI design.</p>
              
            <p>However, this is not all about me. I can create amazing spaces and experiences because I am also .....</p>

          <h4>An Architect</h4>
            <p>As an architecture professional I have developed the skills that allow me to understand how people interact with their environment, how to generate emotions in them through sounds, materials, color, smells and spatial dimensions. I have learned how to create new experiences and allow them to feel at ease in the places where they live, work, have fun and create memories. </p>

            <p>  I studied architecture wishing to be able to generate a great impact on people's lives and little by little I acquired the sensibility to achieve it. This knowledge along with my passion for technology, innovation and video games led me to want to transfer my knowledge to digital reality in order to help create emotionally impactful digital spaces. That's why I also trained in tools like Unity, Blender and Z-Brush to be able to create and develop with my own hands interactive spaces that evoke emotions, fulfill dreams and allow us to navigate unimaginable spaces in the most real, immersive and enjoyable way possible. </p>
